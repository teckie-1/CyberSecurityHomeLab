My Homelab Experience
Cybersecurity Home Lab: A Hands-On Learning Journey

I am actively developing my cybersecurity skills through hands-on practice in a dedicated home lab. Using VMware Workstation Pro, I have set up a Kali Linux environment to explore penetration testing and ethical hacking. My goal is to build a strong foundation in security tools and techniques while applying them to real-world scenarios.
Current Focus & Learning Path

I am currently working through TryHackMe challenges and OverTheWire war games, which have helped me gain experience in:

    Linux privilege escalation – Understanding file permissions, SUID binaries, and misconfigurations.
    Networking fundamentals – Analyzing ports, protocols, and reconnaissance techniques.
    Command-line tools for enumeration and initial access – Using nmap, netcat, and other essential tools.

While I am still exploring many security tools, I enjoy troubleshooting complex problems and picking up new concepts quickly. I am especially interested in vulnerability analysis, privilege escalation, and exploit development as I continue my learning journey.
Next Steps

    Gaining hands-on experience with Metasploit, Burp Suite, and Wireshark.
    Advancing through more TryHackMe rooms and progressing in OverTheWire challenges.
    Exploring Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions to apply my skills in practical, real-world scenarios.
