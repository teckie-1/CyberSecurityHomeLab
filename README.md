<h1>My Homelab Experience</h1>

Cybersecurity Home Lab: A Learning Journey
Overview

I am in the process of building my cybersecurity skills through hands-on practice in a home lab. Using VMware Pro, I have set up a Kali Linux environment to explore penetration testing and ethical hacking. My goal is to develop a strong foundation in security tools and techniques while applying what I learn in real-world scenarios.
Current Focus & Learning Path

I am actively working through TryHackMe challenges and OverTheWire war games, which have helped me understand concepts like:

    Basic Linux privilege escalation techniques.
    Networking fundamentals (ports, protocols, and reconnaissance).
    Command-line tools for enumeration and initial access.

While I am still exploring many security tools, I pick up new concepts quickly and enjoy troubleshooting complex problems. I am particularly interested in improving my skills in vulnerability analysis, privilege escalation, and exploit development as I continue my learning journey.
Next Steps

    Gaining hands-on experience with Metasploit, Burp Suite, and Wireshark.
    Completing more TryHackMe rooms and progressing in OverTheWire challenges.
    Exploring capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios.
